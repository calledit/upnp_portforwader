Answers UPNP questions about

Responds that it has portforwarded the port.
But acctualy does nothing more than printing the requested port on the command line. So that one can add the portforward manualy.

I have tested the server with my PS4 it seams to think it is ok.

It only implements 2 Internet Gateway Device Protocol calls (and only on a basic
level)
